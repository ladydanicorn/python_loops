1. The Range Riddle
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of Python's range() function.

Task 1: Your Mood Today Write a program that prints off different moods for each day of the week. Create a list of moods such as "Happy", "Sad", "Energetic", and "Calm". Using the range() function, loop through every day of the week and for each day, randomly select a mood from the list and print it. Ensure that your program includes the use of the random module to select the mood.

Example Outcome: An example output could be "On Wednesday, you were feeling happy." "On Thursday you were feeling sad."

2. Double Scoop with Nested Loops
Objective: The aim of this assignment is to practice using nested loops in Python.

Task 1: Your Mood Tracker Simulate a mood tracker that records your mood at three different times of the day (morning, afternoon, evening) for each day of the week. Use nested loops to implement this: the outer loop should iterate over the days, and the inner loop should iterate over the times of the day. For each time, randomly select a mood from a predefined list and print it. Use the random module again to randomly select the mood.

Example Outcome: An example would be "On Tuesday afternoon you were sad" "On Tuesday night you were happy" "On Wednesday morning you were tired"
